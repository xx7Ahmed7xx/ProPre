ProPre (Protein Prediction) is a registered trademark of the medical engineers who are responsible for it's existence.
In this repository, You have within your hands a very great and talented project that is made specifically to help medical informaticians and others who are interested to use the great power of computers and achieve their needs.
## How to use
You have two seperate projects, one built with ASP.NET Core 6, and the other with Flask 2.x
They both need to run on the same server, Note that the flask app is made to statically use port 57000.
Once both are run and ready to operate, You can navigate through the ASP application and use it's views to enjoy the funcations within it.
## Who are we
We are some talented and ambitious students in Medical Informatics, We love making tools that help others and also enjoy bringing ideas into life.
The people who worked hard to get this project done:
1. Ahmed Ayman Mansour (Backend - Data Science Engineer)
2. Ahmed Alaa Elsayed AbdelGhaffar (Backend - Machine Learning Engineer)
3. AbdelRahman Mohammed ElFarsy (Backend - Machine Learning Engineer)
4. Ahmed Mohammed ElDreny (Frontend - React.js Software Developer)
5. Osama Samir Etman (Frontend - UI/UX Engineer)

## The purpose of the solution
1. You can get the 3D simulation of your DNA sequence, and predict the probability of having specific diseases in your DNA (more will be added)
2. You can visualize and edit the 3D Visualization you got from out solution or from elsewhere.
more coming soon!
